# Sidely AI Form App Frontend in Visual Basic

## Overview
Sidely AI Frontend is a user interface application developed in Visual Basic. It provides a streamlined interface for interacting with AI-powered backend services. The application allows users to perform tasks related to managing and interacting with AI models, such as creating new submissions, viewing existing submissions, deleting submissions, and controlling a stopwatch feature.

## Key Features

### Submission Management
- **Create New Submission:** Users can fill out fields for Name, Email, Phone Number, and a GitHub repo link. There's also a feature to manage a stopwatch, allowing users to start, pause, and resume timing as needed.
- **Submit to Backend:** Once details are filled, users can submit the form to the backend server via API calls.
- **Delete Submission:** Users can delete a submission by providing the associated email. This feature allows for easy management and removal of outdated or incorrect entries.

### Submission Viewing
- **View Submissions:** Users can navigate through existing submissions stored in the backend. The interface includes "Previous" and "Next" buttons to cycle through submissions one by one.

### Integration with Backend
- **API Integration:** The frontend communicates with a backend server (implemented separately) using HTTP requests. This includes endpoints for saving new submissions (`/submit`), retrieving saved submissions (`/read`), and deleting submissions (`/delete`).

### User Interface
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Each button in the application has associated keyboard shortcuts for quick access
